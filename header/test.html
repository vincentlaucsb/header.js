        <h1>My Life</h1>
        <p>Now this is a story all about how<br />
        My life got flipped turned upside down<br />
        And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there<br />
        I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air</p>
        <p>In west Philadelphia born and raised<br />
        On the playground is where I spent most of my days<br />
        Chillin' out max, and relaxin' all cool<br />
        And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school<br />
        When a couple of guys who were up to no good<br />
        Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood<br />
        I got in one little fight and my mom got scared<br />
        And said you're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air</p>
        <p>I begged and pleaded with her day after day<br />
        But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way<br />
        She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket<br />
        Put my walkman on and said I might as well kick it<br />
        First class yo this is bad</p>
        <p>Drinkin' orange juice out of a champagne glass<br />
        Is this what the people of Bel-Air live like<br />
        Hmmm this might be all right<br />
        But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that<br />
        Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?<br />
        I don't think so I'll see when I get there<br />
        I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air</p>
        <p>Well uh the plane landed and when I came out<br />
        There was a dude looked like a cop standin' there with my name out<br />
        I ain't tryin' to get arrested yet I just got here<br />
        I sprang with the quickness like lightning disappeared<br />
        I whistled for a cab and when it came near<br />
        The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror<br />
        If anything I could say that this cab was rare<br />
        But I thought "Nah forget it, yo holmes to Bel-Air!"</p>
        <p>I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8<br />
        And I yelled to the cabbie "yo homes smell ya later"<br />
        Looked at my kingdom I was finally there<br />
        To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air</p>
